# coreExamples

This repository contains the examples contained within the _core1_ Arduino Integration package (See here: https://wonkystuff.github.io/arduino/).

The **Core1** is available from https://wonkystuff.net/ in two forms:

- a battery powered desktop version;
- a version for the Tangible Waves AE Modular system.

Both versions are programmed via an audio file, using the Arduino integration package as well as by simply playing the appropriate WAV file into the device.

The **core1** devices are based on the ATTiny85 device, a small 8 bit microcontroller.
